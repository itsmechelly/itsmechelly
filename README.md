<h1 style="font-size:300%;">  Hi there,
  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/mGcNjsfWAjY5AEZNw6/giphy.gif" width="50">
  <br>
  My name is Chelly Izraelov,
  Nice to meet you! 🙂
</h1>

<p>
3 years ago, I fell in love with writing code.<br/>
At first, as in all things I like to do, it was very challenging, it was a new and fascinating world with endless knowledge.<br/>
Then I graduate from college course with a GPA of 97. At the same time, I started giving short lectures about various tech-topics, and very quickly found a job as a Backend Software Developer.<br/>
I really loved this position; it was fun and challenging at the same time.<br/>
But then, unfortunately, I had to leave work due to a temporary medical condition that did not allow me to work.<br/>
And now - after I've returned to stable health, stronger than ever, I'm ready to get back on track and I'm coming with endless passion!<br/><br/>

  
  
⭐ I am a professional and passionate Software Developer, proficient with Java language and Spring Framework.<br/>
⭐ Have the interest and the ability to learn other coding languages and technologies as needed.<br/>
⭐ Consider myself to be a very determined and self-motivated individual with an outstanding ‘Can-Do’ Attitude.<br/>
⭐ Excellent communication skills, a team-player, and always seeking to assist in my environment.<br/>
